**ESPN Fantasy Football League Automation**

* I had some free time and decided to have some fun building a concise Python tool to help determine who is owed weekly payouts in my ESPN fantasy football league
* I might expand on this come next season to automate sending emails to myself with this information, scheduling the script to be run every Monday night at 11:45PM (the end of the standard fantasy football week), but since the current season is sadly coming to an end, decided against this for now
